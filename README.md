My First NodeJS Server!

Make private repository nodeServer

Clone repository in command prompt `git clone "repository-link"`

Command from node-package-manager with default answers "-y"
`npm init -y`

For opening VSC
`code .`

You need to install:
`npm install body-parser@1.19.0`
`npm install express@4.17.1`
`npm install helmet@4.17.1`
`npm install babel-core@6.26.3`
`npm install babel-loader@7.1.5`
if there is problem with installation of babel-loader version 7.1.5,
you should ` npm config set legacy-peer-deps true`
and then `npm install babel-loader@7.1.5`
`npm install babel-preset-env@1.7.0`
`npm install babel-preset-stage-2@6.24.1`
